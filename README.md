# The 3 Equation Model Maker
Welcome to the 3 Equation Model Maker, by Neil Majithia
Version: alpha 3

The app is hosted here: https://share.streamlit.io/nevadam/3equationmodelmaker/main/Client.py 

The aim of this program is to plot the exact state of the economy at any time period of a simulated shock.
It's a reconstruction of the Carlin & Soskice macroeconomic simulator (the excel simulator in the folder), built on their work on the 3 equation model.
The simulator outputs a numerical database that is translated into the model via my modelmaker code. This is all hosted on a streamlit web app.

This is still a work in progress, and currently I am working on implementing features to make it more of a learning/teaching aid.

Planned Updates:
* ~~Impulse Response Functions - Alpha3~~
* More columns (e.g. nom rates, q, expectations?) - Alpha4
* Make diagrams look better / more readable based on feedback - Alpha5
* Closed Economy - Beta1
* Aesthetics - Full Release

*One major distinction between my diagrams and source material is the y-axis of the AD-ERU diagram - it's on Q, instead of logQ (q). I don't know whether it's worth changing - this makes more sense in my head, but maybe not for others. If you have an opinion on this, submit it to the issues tab on github or get in touch as below*
