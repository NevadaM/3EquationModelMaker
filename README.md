# The 3 Equation Model Maker
Welcome to the 3 Equation Model Maker, by Neil Majithia

The aim of this program is to plot the exact state of the economy at any time period of a simulated shock. 
It requires the use of the Carlin & Soskice macroeconomic simulator, built on their fantastic work on the 3 equation model.
The simulator outputs impulse response functions and the numerical data behind them. The latter is used here, provided you run the simulator yourself and feed this program the output.

This is still a work in progress, and currently I am working on implementing non-default settings and creating a streamlit web app to display the program.

Thank you for using my project, I hope it's useful!
