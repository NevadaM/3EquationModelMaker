# The 3 Equation Model Maker
Welcome to the 3 Equation Model Maker, by Neil Majithia

The aim of this program is to plot the exact state of the economy at any time period of a simulated shock.
It's a reconstruction of the Carlin & Soskice macroeconomic simulator (the excel simulator in the folder), built on their fantastic work on the 3 equation model.
The simulator outputs a numerical database that is translated into the model via my modelmaker code. This is all hosted on a streamlit website for ease of access.

This is still a work in progress, and currently I am working on implementing features to make it more of a learning/teaching aid, including introducing impulse response functions.

Thank you for using this program - it'll be constantly updated in the hope of it helping with exam season, as well as being entered into ExploreEcon.

Contact neil.majithia@live.co.uk for any queries, my code isn't really well annotated at the moment so things will be very unclear.
